# data_wrangling_project_and_tasks


This repository was created in requirement of the final for QBS 181. 

I have beeen given the permission to make this work public.

There are 4 directories with code created to answer questions relating to each homework assignment and exam. These R and Sql files contain basic maniupulations of data for formatting to address these questions. 
SQL is written with Microsoft SQL Server. 


hw1/ contains hw1.sql, which consists of renaming sql columns and recoding variables as different datatypes.

hw2/ contains hw2.r, which contains Open Database Connectivity ('ODBC') in R to provide similar data manipulation and cleaning, including preliminary numeric analysis.

midterm/ contains midterm.r, which uses SQL through ODBC in R. Here, I implemented multivatiate imputation by chained equations (MICE) to impute data, with an objective of cleaning a dataset given from NIH (NHANES data set,https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2015-2016/DIQ_I.htm).

final contains final.r, final_pt1.sql, final_pt2.sql, which contains manipulation, cleaning and processing of multiple datasets to address questions, in both R (part 2 only) and sql.
